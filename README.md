## Part I - WeatherPy

Using Python script created a visitional fpr weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we utilized a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

FIrst I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships that were asked:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.

Second requirement was to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression is modeling such as any relationships noticed and any other analysis.

Final obersation should include:

* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

Using jupyter-gmaps and the Google places API for this part.

* Created a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I 

  ![heatmap](Images/heatmap.png)

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find the ideal weather condition. 

* Using Google places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.

As final considerations:

* Create a new GitHub repository for this project called `API-Challenge` (note the kebab-case). **Do not add to an existing repo**
* You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
* For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.
